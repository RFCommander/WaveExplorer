# Mathematics in Markdown

This post demonstrates how to use mathematical formulas in our blog posts using MathJax.

<!-- more -->

## Inline Formulas

You can write inline formulas using `\(` and `\)`. For example, here's Einstein's famous equation: \(E = mc^2\).

Here's another example of the quadratic formula: \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\)

## Display Formulas

For larger formulas, you can use `\[` and `\]` to create display-style mathematics. Here's a beautiful integral:

\[
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\]

Here's another example showing the definition of the derivative:

\[
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
\]

## Complex Examples

You can also write more complex mathematical expressions:

### Matrix

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
ax + by \\
cx + dy
\end{pmatrix}
\]

### Sum and Product

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

\[
\prod_{i=1}^n i = n!
\]

### Greek Letters and Special Symbols

* Alpha: \(\alpha\)
* Beta: \(\beta\)
* Gamma: \(\gamma\)
* Pi: \(\pi\)
* Infinity: \(\infty\)
* Partial derivative: \(\partial\)

## Equations with Numbers

You can also write equations with numbers:

\[
\begin{equation}
E = mc^2 \tag{1}
\end{equation}
\]

\[
\begin{equation}
F = ma \tag{2}
\end{equation}
\]

## Conclusion

As you can see, we can write any kind of mathematical formula, from simple inline equations to complex mathematical expressions with matrices, integrals, and more!
